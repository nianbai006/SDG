    Factory function to create the appropriate distributed sampler.

    The sampler strategy is determined by ``config._resolved_sampler_type``,
    which is resolved in ``Arguments._resolve_sampler_type()`` based on the
    user-facing ``data_args.sampler_type`` parameter and async reward detection.

    Returns:
        - GroupContiguousSampler when resolved type is ``"group_contiguous"``
          (keeps each group's samples on the same rank)
        - DistributedKRepeatSampler when resolved type is ``"distributed_k_repeat"``
          (default behavior)
